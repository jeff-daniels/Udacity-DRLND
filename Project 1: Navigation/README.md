# Project 1: Navigation

For this project, you will train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.
A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:

0 - move forward.  
1 - move backward.  
2 - turn left.  
3 - turn right.  

This repository contains: 
- README that describes how someone not familiar with this project should use your repository. The README should be designed for a general audience that may not be familiar with the Nanodegree program; you should describe the environment that you solved, along with how to install the requirements before running the code in your repository.  
- The code that you use for training the agent, along with the trained model weights.  
- A report describing your learning algorithm. This is where you will describe the details of your implementation, along with ideas for future work.

- The Navigation.ipynb file with fully functional code, all code cells executed and displaying output, and all questions answered. You can also download this via your workspace by clicking download as..
- A README.md markdown file with a description of your code, much like this one.
- An HTML or PDF export of the project report with the name Report.html or Report.pdf.
- A file with the saved model weights of the successful agent, can be named something like model.pt.
Any additional images used for the project that were not supplied to you for the project. Please do not include the large banana, project data sets that you may download to work with. These files will make your project too large to submit.
